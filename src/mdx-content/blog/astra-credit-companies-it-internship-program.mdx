# Astra Credit Companies - IT Internship Program

Have you ever imagined that you would be successful in your career one day? I have, however, I have never thought it would be through this one cool journey. Being an intern guy at IT Department in Astra Credit Companies.

A year ago (last year) , I looked for a job just to complete one of my courses while pursuing bachelor degree. At the time, I did not have connection or knowledge about occupational world. 

Lucky me, the IT Department in Astra Credit Companies was recruiting for an internship program. I applied, followed the steps (test, interview), and I was accepted.

Then, they (ACC) sent us (the Intern) to Jakarta for two weeks to be trained and to be introduced to the IT environment. After the training phase, we were sent back to Yogyakarta to do the internship program remotely. They believe that in this digital era, collaboration could be done from everywhere, and that is awesome for me.

They did not just release us to do the work remotely. In Yogyakarta, they also provided us a working space as our working facility. They also gave us a Team Lead from the IT Department (shout out to Mas Novandy, Mba Awa, Mba Christie, Mba Reni and Mas Gadhang). Team Lead’s functions are leading us to the project that was assigned to each of us, and being 'the bridge' from developer (us, the interns) to the other team of the project. Standup meeting, conference call, technical discussion are our daily activities that show us (especially me) how occupational world really need a collaboration.

Furthermore, sometimes the Heads of the IT Department come to visit us in Yogyakarta, looking for something they can improve in this program. It makes us feel more and more part of them even in a long-distance-relationship.

Beside the IT Heads, team of HC (Human Capital) Department also visit us consistently. We are always glad for everytime they come, we would talk about our development progress, potential project, our condition, etc. We would talk about those things in lunch or dinner (of course the payment is on them, hehe).

This Internship program is not just about project and coding. The HC team once gave us something that all workers need; a Vacation. We called this event Outing. We were invited to join outing in Istana Ombak Eco Ressort, Pacitan. No coding, just “a hundred" of fun. This outing intended to bound us as a team and to forget about work for a while.

Therefore, a year being in this internship program is a real fun and full of new experience for me.

To end this article, I'll show you five reasons for you ( as a student) to do an internship before you jump to the real world of working.

Thanks to HC team who has accompanied us from the begining; Mas Oto, Mba Eva and Mas Didit.
